## Config (read before every run)

- `config/call-filter.json` — which Notion pages to process
- `config/taxonomy.json` — signal type → category, owner, feeds
- `config/mrr-thresholds.json` — MRR threshold and severity bump rules
- `config/gchat-templates.json` — the GChat card JSON templates (the ONLY source for cards posted to Google Chat)

## Step 1 — Date window + call query

**Explicit inputs (override the default window):**
The run prompt may carry `Date range: <value>` and/or `Client filter: <name>`
(passed from `daily-ingest.yml` workflow_dispatch inputs). Honor them before
computing any default window:
- `Date range` present → use exactly that range as the date window. Accept a single
  date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) or an inclusive range (`YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD`). Do NOT fall
  back to the Monday/yesterday logic, and do NOT auto-expand when a range is given.
- `Client filter` present → additionally require the page title (`Discovery`) to start
  with that client name. Match case-insensitively.
- Neither present → use the default window below.

**Default date window (no explicit inputs):**
- Monday: prior Mon–Fri
- All other days: yesterday
- No results found: expand back 1 day per iteration, max 7 days
- All calls in window already have `Added to Google Chat = true`: print "Nothing new" and stop

**Process every qualifying call in the window — there is no cap on the number of
calls.** ("Top 3" in Step 7 refers to signals shown *per call* in one feed, not a
limit on calls.) Only `Status = Recent Client Meeting` pages are processed; `Upcoming`
meetings are never processed and never posted to Google Chat.

**Query MeetingDiary** using `notion-search`:
- `Status` = values in `call-filter.json → status`
- `Meeting Type` = values in `call-filter.json → meeting_type_include`
- `Added to Google Chat` = false
- `Meeting Date` within date window
- `[NEW] GDrive Transcript URL` or `GDrive Transcript URL` is not empty

**Extract from each page:**
- `meeting_page_id` — Notion page ID
- `notion_page_url` — full Notion URL (stored in every theme occurrence)
- `client` — from page title (`Discovery` field, format: `ClientName.YYYY.MM.DD`)
- `call_date` — from `Meeting Date` field
- `meeting_type` — from `Meeting Type` field
- `hyly_lead` — from `Hyly Lead` person field (extract display name)

---

## Step 2 — MRR lookup

For each call:
1. Read `📈 sdb.DealStrategy` relation from the MeetingDiary page
2. Fetch the related DealStrategy record
3. Read the MRR field

- MRR > `mrr-thresholds.json → mrr_high_threshold` → `mrr_tier = high`
- Relation missing, record not found, or MRR field empty → `mrr_tier = standard`

---

## Step 3 — Transcript fetch

Check transcript URL fields in priority order from `call-filter.json → transcript_fields_priority`:
1. `[NEW] GDrive Transcript URL`
2. `GDrive Transcript URL`

Use the first non-empty value.

**Extract File ID** from URL: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view`

**Download:** `mcp__51a97106-00b1-4ed9-af0f-46226519d15b__download_file_content` → base64 → decode to VTT text

**If fetch fails or both fields empty:**
- Log in run summary: `[client] [call_date] — transcript not accessible`
- Leave `Added to Google Chat = false`
- Skip this call, continue to next

---

## Step 4 — Signal analysis (single pass, max 6 signals per call)

Read routing **and the definition of each signal type** from `config/taxonomy.json`.
The `definition` field on each type is the canonical test for whether an observation
is that signal — match against it, do not improvise type boundaries. The short list at
the bottom of this step is a quick index only; `taxonomy.json` is authoritative.

For each signal extract:
- `signal_type` — one of the 12 types in taxonomy.json
- `category` — from taxonomy.json (do not derive independently)
- `theme_slug` — format: `[signal]_[category]_[descriptive_name]`
  - Descriptive name: 3–5 words, snake_case, specific not generic
  - Example: `knowledge_enablement_blast_segmentation_by_building`
  - Check `themes/` directory first — if a matching theme file exists, use its exact slug
- `verbatim_quote` — 50–120 chars, include speaker name and transcript timestamp: `"[Speaker, HH:MM] quote text"`
- `context` — 1 sentence explaining what the observation reveals
- `severity_raw` — assign per the rubric below using the scale for the target feed from
  `mrr-thresholds.json → severity_scales`. (Product signals carry a product-feed severity;
  every signal also carries a client-feed severity.)

  **Severity rubric (content-only, before revenue weighting):**

  | client_meeting_feed | product_digest_feed | When to assign |
  |---|---|---|
  | `act_now` | `high` | Blocks the client's stated goal now, churn/escalation language, or an explicit ask with a deadline. |
  | `watch`   | `medium` | Friction or a gap that matters but has a workaround / no immediate deadline. |
  | `healthy` | `low` | Informational, minor, or positive-leaning; no action needed yet. |
  | —         | `critical` | Reserved — only reached via the revenue bump in Step 5. Do **not** assign `critical` from content alone. |
- `positive_subtype` — if `positive`: one of `advocacy | endorsement | expansion_intent | trust_signal`

**Detect all 12 types:**
1. `knowledge` — client unaware of platform capability
2. `skill` — rep misses feature opportunity or frames incorrectly
3. `asset` — missing training material or guide
4. `response` — rep gives inconsistent answer to recurring question
5. `comms` — client discovers limitation live on call
6. `process` — broken pre/post-training workflow
7. `feature_gap` — client requests missing feature
8. `expectation` — client had wrong product expectation
9. `limit` — client hits hard platform constraint
10. `competitor` — competitor named on call
11. `positive` — advocacy / endorsement / expansion intent / trust signal
12. `positioning` — rep struggles with competitive or change messaging

---

## Step 5 — Revenue weighting (severity promotion)

This is the **only** promotion step. `severity_final` = `severity_raw` unless the call's
`mrr_tier = high`, in which case bump it one rung using
`mrr-thresholds.json → severity_bump_when_mrr_high` for that feed:

- `client_meeting_feed`: `watch → act_now` (an `act_now` stays `act_now`; `healthy` does not bump).
- `product_digest_feed`: `low → medium`, `medium → high`, `high → critical`.

So a product signal becomes **`critical` only** when its content rubric gave it `high`
**and** the account is high-MRR (`MRR > mrr-thresholds.json → mrr_high_threshold`). No
other path reaches `critical`. Set `severity_final` for each feed the signal routes to.

---

## Step 6 — Idempotency check

For each signal:
1. Check if `themes/[theme_slug].md` exists
2. If it exists, check the Occurrences table for a row matching this `notion_page_url`
3. Match found → skip this signal (already logged), continue

---

## Step 7 — Route to feeds

Feeds for each signal type come from `config/taxonomy.json → feeds`.

**GChat allowlist check — REQUIRED before any post:**
Before posting any card to any GChat feed (or any external destination including the
feature request test DB), check whether the client matches an entry in
`mrr-thresholds.json → gchat_client_allowlist` using this two-step lookup:

**Step A — HubSpot `managementcompany` match (first try):**
Read the `Management Company Name` property from the client's HubSpot record (via the
DealStrategy relation on the MeetingDiary page). Compare case-insensitively against each
allowlist entry. The client name must start with or equal the allowlist entry.

**Step B — Notion page name semantic match (second try, fallback only):**
If the `managementcompany` field is empty, missing, or yields no allowlist match, fall
back to a semantic/fuzzy match of the MeetingDiary page name (the `ClientName` prefix
from `ClientName.YYYY.MM.DD`) against the allowlist entries. Use the same
case-insensitive prefix rule.

- **Match found (either step)** → post to GChat feeds normally.
- **No match after both steps** → skip all GChat posts for this call. Still write
  theme files (Step 8) and set `Added to Google Chat = true` (Step 9) so the call is
  not reprocessed. Log in the run summary as "processed (GChat skipped — not in allowlist)".

This means signals are captured for ALL clients, but external notifications are
restricted to allowlisted clients only.

**Card format — REQUIRED:** Every card posted to Google Chat (any feed) MUST be built
from `config/gchat-templates.json`. This is the single source of truth for card layout —
look up the matching template by name (`client_meeting_card`, `product_digest_critical`,
`weekly_product_digest`, `positive_signal`, etc.), fill its placeholders, and POST that
JSON to the `GCHAT_WEBHOOK`. Do NOT hand-build card JSON or invent a different layout.
The text blocks below are field-mapping references only — the actual payload comes from
the template file.

### client_meeting_feed (every call; top 3 signals per call by severity)

**Selecting the 3 signals:** rank that call's detected signals by `severity_final` on the
client scale (`act_now` > `watch` > `healthy`); break ties by `mrr_tier` (high first),
then by order detected. Take the top 3 and map them to the rows below
(🔴 act_now / 🟡 watch / 🟢 healthy). If the call has fewer than 3 signals, show only
those. **All** detected signals (up to the Step 4 cap of 6) are still written to `themes/`
in Step 8 — the top-3 cut applies only to this card.

```
📋 [Client] — [Meeting Type] — [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Hyly Lead]

🔴 Act Now: [theme_slug] — [context]
🟡 Watch: [theme_slug] — [context]
🟢 Healthy: [theme_slug] — [context]

Source: [Notion URL] — [HH:MM]
```

### product_digest_feed

**Selecting a Critical Gap:** post this card immediately (any day) for any product signal
(`feature_gap`, `expectation`, `limit`) whose `severity_final` on the product scale is
`critical`. Per Step 5 that means a `high`-rubric product signal on a high-MRR account.
Non-critical product signals are not posted immediately — they are picked up by the
Monday weekly digest. One card per critical signal.

```
🚨 Critical Gap Alert — [Client] — [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Hyly Lead]
Signal: [theme_slug]
MRR: $[X]/month
Severity: Critical — [reason]
"[verbatim_quote]"
Source: [Notion URL] — [HH:MM]
Action required: PM to confirm owner and response plan before end of day.
```

**Monday weekly digest** — compiled from `themes/` folder by `weekly-digest.yml` (not this job).

### marketing_feed (per positive signal)

```
🟢 Positive Signal — [Client] — [YYYY-MM-DD] — [Hyly Lead]
Subtype: [advocacy | endorsement | expansion_intent | trust_signal]
MRR: $[X]/month
"[verbatim_quote]"
Source: [Notion URL] — [HH:MM]
Suggested action: [advocacy→case study | endorsement→social proof | expansion_intent→alert CSM+AE | trust_signal→relationship tracker]
```

**TEST_MODE = true:** Print all cards to chat with `[TEST — NOT SENT]`. Do not call webhook.

---

## Step 8 — Write theme files

For each signal processed (not skipped as duplicate):

**If `themes/[theme_slug].md` does not exist** — create it:

```markdown
---
theme_slug: [theme_slug]
signal_type: [signal_type]
category: [category]
owner: [owner from taxonomy.json]
status: candidate
client_count: 1
first_seen: [call_date]
last_seen: [call_date]
---

[One-line description of what this theme represents.]

## Occurrences

| Client | Date | Notion Page | Quote | Timestamp |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| [client] | [call_date] | [Meeting]([notion_page_url]) | "[verbatim_quote]" | [HH:MM] |
```

**If `themes/[theme_slug].md` exists** — append a row to the Occurrences table and update frontmatter:
- `client_count` += 1
- `last_seen` = call_date
- `status`: 1 client → `candidate`, 2 clients → `emerging`, 3+ clients → `theme`

---

## Step 9 — Update MeetingDiary

Transcript processed successfully → set `Added to Google Chat = true` on the Notion page.
Transcript not accessible → leave `false`.

---

## Monday: weekly digest

Handled by `weekly-digest.yml` workflow after daily ingest completes.
Reads `themes/` folder, filters signals from past 7 days in Occurrences tables,
compiles digest card, posts to `product_digest_feed`.

---
